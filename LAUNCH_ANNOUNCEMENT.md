## 🎯 What We're Launching

**gICM://SEND** - The AI Marketplace for Web3 Builders

The first marketplace that lets you build custom AI development stacks using Progressive Disclosure architecture. Mix and match from 362 production-ready components to create your perfect AI assistant.

### By The Numbers

- **91 specialized agents** - From ICM Anchor Architect to Frontend Fusion Engine
- **96 progressive skills** - Modular expertise from Solana to Next.js
- **93 commands** - One-shot workflows for common tasks
- **82 MCP integrations** - Connect to external tools and services
- **48 production settings** - Fine-tune your Claude Code experience

**Result:** 88-92% token savings through intelligent context loading

## 💡 Key Innovation: Progressive Disclosure

Unlike traditional AI prompts that load everything upfront, gICM uses a **three-layer architecture**:

1. **Skills** (5-15KB) - Load only when triggered by keywords
2. **Commands** (2-8KB) - One-shot workflows for specific tasks
3. **Agents** (20-50KB) - Deep specialists for complex work

Your AI assistant only loads what it needs, when it needs it.

🚀 Launching gICM://SEND

The first AI marketplace for Web3 builders using Progressive Disclosure architecture.

91 agents • 96 skills • 93 commands • 82 MCPs
= 88-92% token savings

Build your custom AI dev stack at gicm.io ⚡️

🧵 Here's why this matters...
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
```
Problem: Traditional AI prompts load EVERYTHING upfront

❌ 500KB+ context per request
❌ Irrelevant information cluttering responses
❌ Token costs spiraling out of control
❌ Generic responses lacking deep expertise

There's a better way...
```

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
```
Solution: Progressive Disclosure Architecture

✅ Skills (5-15KB) - Load on keyword trigger
✅ Commands (2-8KB) - One-shot workflows
✅ Agents (20-50KB) - Deep specialists

Only load what you need, when you need it.

Result: 88-92% token savings 📉
```

**Tweet 4 (Example):**
```
Example: Building a Solana launch platform

Without gICM:
- Load entire Web3 knowledge base (2.4MB)
- Generic blockchain advice
- No ICM Motion patterns

With gICM:
- ICM Anchor Architect agent (42KB)
- Solana-specific skills
- Production-proven patterns

10x more relevant, 50x smaller context ⚡️

### Product Hunt Launch

**Tagline:**
"Build custom AI dev stacks with 91 agents, 96 skills, and 88-92% token savings"

**Description:**
gICM://SEND is the first marketplace for building custom AI development assistants using Progressive Disclosure architecture. Instead of loading massive 500KB+ prompts upfront, our three-layer system (skills, commands, agents) only loads what you need, when you need it.

Perfect for Web3 builders who need deep expertise in Solana, EVM, DeFi, and full-stack development without the bloat.

**First Comment:**
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Mirko, creator of gICM://SEND.

This project started when I was building ICM Motion (Solana launch platform) and got frustrated with generic AI responses. I needed an AI that understood:
- Anchor framework specifics
- Bonding curve mathematics
- Production security patterns
- ICM Motion's architecture

So I built it.

But then I realized - every builder has different needs. Why not let people build their own custom AI dev stacks?

That's gICM://SEND:
- 362 modular components
- Mix and match for your stack
- 88-92% token savings
- One-command installation

Try the Stack Builder at gicm.io/stack

Happy to answer any questions! 🚀

**r/solana:**
```
Built a marketplace for Solana dev-focused AI assistants [gICM://SEND]

Features ICM Anchor Architect - specialized agent for:
- Anchor framework patterns
- Bonding curve implementations
- PDA derivation & CPI
- Production security patterns

Plus 90 other agents for full-stack Web3 development.

Uses Progressive Disclosure to keep context small (88-92% token savings).

Check it out: gicm.io

Open to feedback from the Solana community!

**r/webdev:**
```
I built a marketplace for custom AI development assistants [gICM://SEND]

Problem: Generic AI prompts are huge (500KB+) and give generic advice.

Solution: Progressive Disclosure architecture
- Skills load on keyword trigger (5-15KB)
- Commands for one-shot tasks (2-8KB)
- Agents for deep expertise (20-50KB)

Result: 88-92% smaller context, 10x more relevant responses.

Built for Web3 but principles apply to any domain.
