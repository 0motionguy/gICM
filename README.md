## Documentation

- **[docs/MULTI_PLATFORM.md](./docs/MULTI_PLATFORM.md)** - Complete multi-platform architecture guide

---

## Key Concepts

### Progressive Disclosure Skills

Skills load in **30-50 tokens** initially, then expand on-demand to full documentation (3000-5000 tokens). Achieves **88-92% token savings**.

### Agent Specialization

Each of the 108 agents has a specific domain. Route tasks appropriately:

- UI work → `Frontend Fusion Engine` or `UI/UX Designer`
- Security → `Solana Guardian Auditor` or `Smart Contract Forensics`
- DevOps → `CI/CD Pipeline Engineer`

### Dependency Resolution

The stack builder automatically resolves dependencies. If you select an item that depends on others, they're auto-included in the export.
