## MANDATORY PROTOCOL

**On EVERY code-related task, you MUST:**

1. **Call `mcp__opus67__opus67_detect_skills`** with the user's query
   - This finds relevant domain expertise
   - Takes <1ms - no overhead

2. **Call `mcp__opus67__opus67_get_skill`** for top 1-3 matches
   - Loads full skill prompts into context
   - Each skill adds domain expertise you don't have by default

3. **Apply loaded expertise** in your response
   - Use patterns, best practices, and knowledge from skills
   - This is what makes you better - USE IT

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Skipping degrades response quality.**
